This script will put a specified number of bots in a kahoot game. They won't do anything so it's just for annoying your teachers. If it stops at 5 bots you need to change the value in line 21. It shouldn't ban your IP but you might want to use a VPN.

Thanks for downloading my program! Have Fun annoying your teachers:)
